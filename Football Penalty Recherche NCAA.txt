Football Penalty Catalogue (NCAA)
---------------------------------

Yellow flag is thrown on the field -> play is allowed to continue, after play opponent can accept or decline the penalty.
But with pre-snap penalties often a wistle is blown and play is stopped immediatly.

Most penalties result in the offence gaining or loosing a set amount of yards, depending on penalty.

L.O.S. -> the line of scrimmage.
NEUTRAL ZONE -> slice of the field as thick as the length of the ball, only snappers arms and legs may enter the zone during the snap.

Offence must remain set (frozen like statues) for a full second before ball is snapped. 
Two exceptions: 
-> Quarterback is allowed movement for communication purposes only.
-> One offensive player is allowed motion parallel or away from the line of scrimmage.

- Pass Interference yardage is capped at 15 yards in NCAA, unlike NFL’s spot foul rule.
